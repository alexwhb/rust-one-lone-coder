# Rust - One Lone Coder
I'm working though some of the one lone coder projects but writing them in Rust. I'm not super experenced in Rust, so 
don't take my implementations as best practices, but I'm doing my best to be idiomatic. If you're not aware of [One Lone Coder](https://www.youtube.com/@javidx9)... you should check out his Youtube channel he's an excellent teacher. He mostly writes in C++ from what I've seen. And I'm wanting to learn a new language so I decided to challange myself by writing a few of his projects in Rust. 


Projects so far:
